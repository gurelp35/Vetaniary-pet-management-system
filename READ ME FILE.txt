Veterinary Management System
Presented by:Pakize Gurel GUR23612588

Project Description:
This C++ console application is developed to support daily operations in a veterinary clinic. The system allows users to manage pet profiles, owner information, and veterinary appointments efficiently. It is built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and ensures a clear separation of responsibilities across the application.
Key Features:
Create, update, and delete pet records
Manage owner profiles with validation checks
Schedule, edit, complete, or cancel appointments
View upcoming and past appointments for specific pets
Role-based access for Veterinarian, Admin, and Staff users
Data persistence using plain text files for portability and simplicity
Class Structure:
Pet: Handles animal-related data such as name, breed, age, vaccination status, and medical history.
Owner: Stores personal details of pet owners including name, contact number, email, and address.
Appointment: Links pets and their owners with a scheduled date and time, including appointment status.
Design Approach:
Separation of classes ensures modularity and easier debugging.
Validation functions are used to prevent invalid data entry.
Text files are used for storing records to simplify deployment and avoid database dependency.
The user interface is menu-driven, with role-based restrictions to control system access.
File Overview:
pets.txt: Stores pet records
owners.txt: Stores owner information
appointments.txt: Stores appointment schedules and statuses
How to Run the Program:
Open the project in an IDE such as Visual Studio.
Ensure the main() function is included in the source code.
Compile and run the program using the IDE's build tools.
Follow the on-screen menu instructions after selecting a user role (Veterinarian, Admin, Staff).
Usage Notes:
Inputs are validated for correctness (e.g., age must be positive, emails must follow proper format).
Only allowed roles can perform specific operations (e.g., only Veterinarians can update medical records).
Appointments can be filtered by status or pet name to view upcoming or completed visits.
Testing Examples:
Pet Age: -2 → Error: Invalid input. Age must be a positive number.
Email: wrong@@mail → Error: Invalid email format.
Date: 32/13/2025 → Error: Invalid date.
