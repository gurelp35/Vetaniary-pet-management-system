# Veterinary Pet Management System (C++)

A structured C++ application designed to manage veterinary pet records using object-oriented programming principles.

The system implements data modelling, validation logic, and file handling mechanisms to store and manage pet information efficiently.

---

## Project Overview

This application models a simplified veterinary record system where pet data can be created, validated, and stored persistently.

The project demonstrates:

- Object-oriented design
- Class implementation and constructors
- Encapsulation of data
- Input validation
- File-based data storage
- Structured program organisation

---

## Technical Implementation

The system:

- Defines a structured Pet class
- Implements constructors and member functions
- Validates user input to ensure data integrity
- Stores records using file handling operations
- Applies modular code structure for maintainability

---

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File I/O operations
- Object-Oriented Programming principles

---

## Development Focus

This project reflects applied understanding of:

- Class-based system design
- Data abstraction and encapsulation
- Structured problem solving
- Clean and maintainable C++ coding practices
